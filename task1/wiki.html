    <p class="p2"><img src="images/CS1.6.jpg" alt="CS1.6" class="left-img">Counter-Strike (officially abbreviated as CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games,
    in which teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists battle to, respectively, perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking)
    and prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first version of Counter-Strike.
    It was initially released as a modification for Half-Life and designed by Minh "Gooseman" Le and Jess "Cliffe" Cliffe,
    before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.</p>

    <p class="p2"><img src="images/CSGO.jpg" alt="CSGO" class="right-img">The game was followed-up with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004.
    Later that same year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve.
    Released only eight months after Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, in November 2004, the game was a remake of the original
    Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine. The fourth game in the main
    series to have been developed by Valve, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.
    Hidden Path Entertainment, who also worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.
    Several spin-off titles have been released for Asian territories.</p>
    <h2>Counter-Strike</h2>
    <p class="p2">Originally a modification for Half-Life, the rights to Counter-Strike, as well as the developers working on it, were acquired by Valve Corporation in 2000.
    The game received a port to Xbox in 2003. It was also ported to OS X and Linux in the form of a beta in January 2013. A full release was published in April 2013.</p>
    <h2>Counter-Strike: Source</h2>
    <p class="p2">
    Counter-Strike: Source was the first publicly released game by Valve Corporation to run on the Source engine.
    Counter-Strike: Source was initially released as a beta to members of the Valve Cyber Caf√© Program on August 11, 2004.
    On August 18, 2004, the beta was released to owners of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and those who had received a Half-Life 2
    voucher bundled with some ATI Radeon video cards. While the original release only included a version for Microsoft Windows,
    the game eventually received a port to OS X on June 23, 2010 with a Linux port afterwards in 2013.
    </p>
    <h2>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h2>
    <p class="p2">
    Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (abbreviated as CS:GO) was the fourth release in the main, Valve-developed Counter-Strike series in 2012.
    Much like Counter-Strike: Source the game runs on the Source engine. It is available on Microsoft Windows, OSX, and Linux,
    as well as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles, and is backwards compatible on the Xbox One console.
