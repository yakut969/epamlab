      DreamHack has announced details about the qualifying process for the upcoming Winter event.
      The 2016 DreamHack ZOWIE Open season will come to a close next month at the prestigious Winter event, which will be held from November 24-27 at the Elmia Exhibition and Convention Centre, in Jönköping.
      Eight Counter-Strike teams will compete for their share of a $100,000 prize pool, with six of them being directly invited by DreamHack. Alongside the invitees, there will be two teams determined by a European qualifier hosted by ESEA on October 15-16.
      The qualifier will consist of two stages, with the first being an open 512-team cup, which will determine the eight teams who will advance to the closed best-of-three bracket, where they will be joined by eight invited sides, to be revealed towards the end of the week.

      A new beta branch of CS:GO, version 1.35.5.3rc, has released and it features a revised version of Inferno as well as a number of other fixes to recently reported bugs.
      The main selling point of tonight's prerelease update is a revised Inferno, which has already received massive acclaim on social media from pros and community members for being a noticeably improved rework of the map.
      A run-through of the map that shows that many of the old maps flaw's have received a Valve makeover, such as poor visibility on the A bombsite and an overall dark map design, a too narrow chokepoint at Banana, and clunky car models which impeded firefights.
      Valve have also seemingly been quite active in responding to bug reports for a number of issues which were introduced with the recent hitbox updates.
      As a result, this branch sees a couple of changes to crouch spamming in mid-air, remaining crouched while taking over a bot, a buggy bomb plant animation while crouched, a molotov bug related to not exploding on ledges, and viewmodel distortion when looking straight up or down.
      In addition, Windows 10 users who are not quite tech savvy might rejoice from a new in-game recommendation which explains how to disable the frame limiting Xbox DVR effect and the UI for the amount of blur one experiences while moving and scoped-in has been updated to more correctly reflect one's inaccuracy.

      The draw for the group stage of IEM Oakland has been made, with the participating teams having been drawn into two groups.
      After hosting two Intel Extreme Masters events in San Jose, ESL takes the prestigious competition to Oakland, where the Oracle Arena, home of NBA franchise Golden State Warriors, will stage from November 19-20 a $300,000 tournament featuring 12 teams from all over the world.
      Eight spots have been filled through invites, while the remaining four places will be determined by iBUYPOWER Masters, a $100,000 tournament scheduled for November 12-13 that will serve as a qualifier for the IEM event.
      IEM Oakland will kick off with two groups of six teams, who will face each other in a round robin stage. The group winners will advance to the semi-finals, while the second and the third placed teams will move on to the quarter-finals. The first two rounds of the playoffs will feature a best-of-three format, while the title decider will be a best-of-five clash.
